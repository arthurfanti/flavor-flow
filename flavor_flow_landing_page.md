# Design Prompt: Flavor Flow Landing Page

**Aesthetic Concept:** "Editorial Precision meets Dynamic Magic"
**Device Type:** Desktop

## Global Theme
- **Color Palette:** Deep, immersive dark mode using `#0F0F0F` as the primary background. Use `#E05D44` (Terracotta) for primary actions and `#FFBF00` (Neon Amber) for "Magic" glow effects and highlights.
- **Typography:** 
    - **Display (Headings):** Playfair Display (Bold/Italic) for a premium cookbook feel.
    - **UI/Body:** Inter for high-precision functional text.
- **Surface Styling:** Use `#1A1A1A` for cards with `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)` glassmorphic overlays and `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)`.

## Layout Sections

### 1. Navigation Bar
- A fixed, slim glassmorphic bar with the Flavor Flow logo on the left.
- Navigation links (Recipes, Pantry, Planner) in Inter Medium.
- A "Get Started" call-to-action button with a subtle Neon Amber glow.

### 2. Hero Section
- **Heading:** Use a bold, oversized Playfair Display heading: "From Screen to Table, Magically."
- **Subtext:** "The AI-powered kitchen companion that transforms food videos into organized, actionable recipes."
- **Visual:** A high-quality placeholder image of a premium kitchen scene with a dynamic "Magic UI" glow beam (`#FFBF00`) focusing on a mobile device showing a recipe.
- **CTA:** A large Terracotta (`#E05D44`) button with the text "Start Your Culinary Journey."

### 3. Feature Grid (Magic UI Style)
- Three card-based features following an Airbnb-style grid:
    1. **AI Extraction:** "Scan any cooking video to extract ingredients instantly."
    2. **Smart Pantry:** "Keep track of your ingredients with intelligent alerts."
    3. **Meal Planner:** "Organize your week with drag-and-drop simplicity."
- Each card should have a `1px` border using a neon gradient (`#E05D44` to `#FFBF00`) and a subtle hover glow effect.

### 4. Call to Action (Bottom)
- A focused, high-contrast section with a dark surface background.
- Heading: "Ready to upgrade your kitchen?"
- A simple, clean input field for email and a strong "Sign Up" button.

## Specific UI Details
- Use an 8pt grid system for consistent, generous padding (lg: 24px, xl: 32px).
- Apply `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` for all interactive hover states.
- Ensure all borders and icons use the "Silver Metallic" neutral (`#A0A0A0`) for an industrial kitchen feel.
