  "description": "implement auto show/hide behaviour on topbar. On load it is shown, on scroll down it follows to content and scroll until hidden, on scroll up it appears again. It might be a good idea to define a scroll speed limit, under which the topbar do not appears while scrolling up, if the speed increases above the treshold then it appears"
