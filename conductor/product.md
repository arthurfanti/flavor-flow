# Product Guide: Flavor Flow

## Initial Concept
it is a recipe app, but not yet another recipe app, no! it is video-based, so the user inputs a url from youtube, instagram or tiktok and the app extracts from it the ingredients list and the steps. But what really makes it stands out is the fact that it has a shopping list combined, so the usar can select which recipes they want for the week's planning and the app will then add ingredients to the list! also, the app has a pantry view where users can keep track of ingredients they have and ones that are missing.

## Target Users
Flavor Flow is designed for a diverse audience focused on simplifying their cooking and shopping experience:
- **Busy Professionals:** Individuals looking to automate the tedious parts of meal planning and grocery shopping.
- **Social-Media Savvy Cooks:** Food enthusiasts who find inspiration on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok and want an easy way to save and use those recipes.
- **Students and Solo Dwellers:** People managing their own kitchens who need an efficient way to track their pantry and cook simple meals.

## Core Features (MVP)
