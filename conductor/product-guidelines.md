# Product Guidelines: Flavor Flow

## Tone and Voice
- **Warm & Encouraging:** Flavor Flow communicates with a friendly and approachable voice. We want to make the transition from watching a video to cooking a meal feel easy and rewarding.
- **Sophisticated yet Accessible:** While the tone is welcoming, it remains professional and refined, catering to adults who value a well-organized kitchen.

## Visual Identity
- **Premium Dark Mode Aesthetic:** A high-contrast, immersive environment using very dark graphite gray (#121212) and dark surfaces (#1A1A1A) paired with vibrant "Premium Kitchen" accents (Terracotta #E05D44, Sage #8A9A5B).
- **Magic Glow & Glass:** Strategic use of glass morphism (blur), neon gradient borders, and mouse-following lighting effects to guide focus and provide feedback.
- **Adult Aesthetic:** The design avoids overly playful or "cartoonish" elements, opting instead for high-quality imagery, clean lines, and a professional layout.

## Typography
- **Editorial Elegance:** **Playfair Display** (Serif) for headings and recipe titles to provide a high-end cookbook feel.
- **Modern Precision:** **Inter** (Sans-Serif) for body text and UI labels, ensuring clarity and modern functional appeal.

## Layout and UX
- **Airbnb-Inspired Spacing:** Generous, intentional padding and card-based layouts following an 8pt grid system to ensure focus and clarity.
- **Visual-First Strategy:** Since the inspiration comes from video, the app emphasizes large, appetizing imagery and clear video embeds wherever possible.
